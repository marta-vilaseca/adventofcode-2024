### üìñ The setting

**The Chief Historian is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in months!** Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.

**As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a star.** They figure the Chief Historian must be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to **help them get fifty stars on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th**.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. **Good luck!**

## ‚≠ê The challenges
